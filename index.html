        <p>Douglas Crockford is an American computer programmer and entrepreneur who is best known for his ongoing involvement in the development of the JavaScript language, for having popularized the data format JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), 
        and for developing various JavaScript related tools such as JSLint and JSMin. 
        He is currently a senior JavaScript architect at PayPal, and is also a writer and speaker on JavaScript, JSON, and related web technologies.

        <p>Crockford purchased an Atari 8-bit computer in 1980 and wrote the game Galahad and the Holy Grail for the Atari Program Exchange (APX), 
        which resulted in Chris Crawford hiring him at Atari, Inc. While at Atari,Crockford wrote another game, Burgers!, for APX[5] and a number of experimental audio/visual demos that were freely distributed.
        After Warner Communications sold the company he joined National Semiconductor. 
        In 1984 Crockford joined Lucasfilm, and later Paramount Pictures. He became known on video game oriented listservs in the early 1990s after he posted his memoir "The Expurgation of Maniac Mansion" to a videogaming bulletin board. 
        The memoir documented his efforts to censor the computer game Maniac Mansion to Nintendo's satisfaction so that they could release it as a cartridge, and Crockford's mounting frustrations as Nintendo's demands became more obscure and confusing.
